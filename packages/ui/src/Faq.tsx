       <div>How do I book a carpool ride? You can book a carpool ride on our mobile</div> 
       <div> app, or on blablacar.in. Simply search for your destination, choose the
        date you want to travel and pick the carpool that suits you best! Some
        rides can be booked instantly, while other rides require manual approval
        from the driver. Either way, booking a carpool ride is fast, simple and
        easy.</div>

        How do I publish a carpool ride? Offering a carpool ride on BlaBlaCar is
        easy. To publish your ride, use our mobile app or blablacar.in. Indicate
        your departure and arrival points, the date and time of your departure,
        how many passengers you can take and the price per seat. You’ll also
        need to choose how you want to accept bookings (either automatically or
        manually), and you have the option of adding any important details you
        think your passengers should know about. Then tap ‘Publish ride’ and
        you’re done!

      <div className="p-4">
        How do I cancel my carpool ride? If you have a change of plans, you can
        always cancel your carpool ride from the ‘Your rides’ section of our
        app. The sooner you cancel, the better. That way the driver has time to
        accept new passengers. The amount of your refund will depend on how far
        in advance you cancel. If you cancel more than 24 hours before
        departure, for example, you’ll receive a full refund, excluding the
        service fee.

        What are the benefits of travelling by carpool? There are multiple
        advantages to carpooling, over other means of transport. Travelling by
        carpool is usually more affordable, especially for longer distances.
        Carpooling is also more eco-friendly, as sharing a car means there will
        be fewer cars on the road, and therefore fewer emissions. Taking a
        carpool ride is also a safe way to travel in the current times. Because
        there are only a few people in a car, you have fewer points of contact
        and there’s less risk than other travel options.

        How much does a carpool ride cost? The costs of a carpool ride can vary
        greatly, and depend on factors like distance, time of departure, the
        demand of that ride and more. It is also up to the driver to decide how
        much to charge per seat, so it’s hard to put an exact price tag on a
        ride. Check out some of our top carpool destinations to get an idea of
        price, or start searching for your next carpool ride on blablacar.in.
